                <h1>Oscar de la Renta’s Most Memorable Moments in T</h1>
                
                <p>Yesterday, the legendary fashion designer Oscar de la Renta passed away at the age of 82. Here, in honor of his life and work, a look back at some of his unforgettable appearances in the magazine.</p>

                <h4><center>“Oscar’s… Wild!”</center></h4>

                <p>When Cathy Horyn went to visit de la Renta at his home in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, for T’s <strong>Spring 2009 Women’s Fashion</strong> issue, the two discussed everything from de la Renta’s longtime friendship and rivalry with Bill Blass to his first New York employer, Elizabeth Arden, to — at great length — his adoration of his wife of 25 years, Annette. When he realized he was in love, <dd><blockquote>“I didn’t tell her how I felt,” he said. “I said as much as I could say. But after the lunch I wrote her a letter and said that I was in love with her. Then I went to Fred Leighton and bought her a pair of earrings. I sent them to the airport with my driver. When she arrived in Paris, she called me. That was the start.”</blockquote></dd></p>

                <p>For a 2013 <strong>“Take Two”</strong> column, the designer faced off with Chelsea Handler to offer his views on footwear, film, Manet and more.</p>

                <h4><center>“Oscar vs. Oscar”</center></h4>

                <p>On the occasion of a Spring 2005 spread that paired him with the boxer Oscar de la Hoya, the designer cleared up a rumor that he’d once hit a journalist who’d printed something ugly. “I mean, I didn’t knock him out,” de la Renta said. “And I have never, ever been upset by anyone writing a bad critique about my collections. But he said something rude about my wife. And that upset me very, very much, so there was an altercation, let’s say. When I get angry, I can walk through a wall, but I very seldom get angry.”</p>

                <p>“I am a big opera fan. Years ago we were in the same restaurant and I said, ‘Look, it’s Marta and Plácido!’ I was so excited, so I went to meet him. We’ve been friends ever since.”
De la Renta had no trouble making new friends, as illustrated by this anecdote he told us about how he met Plácido Domingo and his wife, Marta Ornelas, at El Museo del Barrio’s annual gala in 2010.</p>

                <p>Last week, as the magazine feted its first decade at Christie’s, Erika Bearman — a.k.a. Oscar PR Girl — Instagrammed a photo of this unforgettable quote from the designer that appeared on a wall.</p>
                
                <dd><blockquote><big>“I love green. In Spanish, we say green is the color of hope. This one is the color of money.”</big></blockquote></dd>
